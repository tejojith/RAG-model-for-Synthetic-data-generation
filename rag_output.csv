Here is the analysis of the provided dataset's columns and classification as to whether each contains PII (Personally Identifiable Information) or sensitive data:

**Output:**

gender - FALSE
lunch - FALSE
math_score - FALSE
parental_level_of_education - FALSE
reading_score - FALSE
race_ethnicity - FALSE
test_preparation_course - FALSE
writing_score - FALSE

Here's the reasoning behind each classification:

* gender, lunch, math_score, reading_score, writing_score: These columns contain non-sensitive data that does not identify a specific individual.
* parental_level_of_education: This column contains information about education level, which is not typically considered PII or sensitive data.
* race_ethnicity: While this column may be sensitive in certain contexts, it is generally not considered PII as it does not uniquely identify an individual.
